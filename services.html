            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">
                Pregnancy occurs when a sperm fertilizes an egg after it's released from
                the ovary during ovulation. The fertilized egg then travels down into the uterus, where implantation
                occurs. A successful implantation results in pregnancy. On average, a full-term pregnancy lasts 40
                weeks. <br>
                Foods to avoid in pregnancy:<br>
           
            <ul>
                <li>Raw or undercooked meat. Avoid undercooked meat, especially sausages or minced meat</li>

                weight gain.
                fatigue.
                increased sensitivity to cold or heat.
                constipation or more frequent bowel movements.

                increased or decreased heart rate.</p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Hormonal imbalances occur when there is too much or too little of a
                hormone in the bloodstream. Because of their essential role in the body, even small hormonal imbalances
                can cause side effects throughout the body. Hormones are chemicals that are produced by glands in the
                endocrine system.</p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">A natural decline in reproductive hormones when a woman reaches her 40s
                or 50s.
                Menopause is signalled by 12 months since last menstruation.
                Common symptoms include hot flashes and vaginal dryness. There may also be sleep disturbances. The
                combination of these symptoms can cause anxiety or depression.
                Menopause is a natural process with treatments that focus on symptomatic relief. Vaginal dryness is
                treated with topical lubricants or oestrogen. Medications can reduce the severity and frequency of hot
                flushes. In special circumstances, oral hormone therapy may be used.</p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">.Once in menopause (you haven't had a period for 12 months) and on into
                postmenopause, the symptoms may continue for an average of four to five years, but they decrease in
                frequency and intensity. Some women report their symptoms last longer. The most common symptoms include:
                Hot flashes.</p>
